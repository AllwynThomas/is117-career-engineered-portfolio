## Orchestration Log
One technical error the agent made was including broken links to the GitHub repo and live demo buttons for the listed projects. The agent also forgot to include the "AWS (EC2)" and "GitHub Actions (CI/CD)" skills in the project that they were used in. I fixed these mistakes by manually updating the broken links and adding span tags for the missing skills.
